Hailing from Pittsburgh, I’m a software developer and tutor with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh. I specialize in backend development, algorithms, and data structures areas I find endlessly fascinating because they form the foundation of innovation.

My journey into tech began at 17, when I discovered the limitless potential of programming. Since then, I’ve embraced coding as a superpower that empowers me to create, innovate, and make a meaningful impact. Whether it’s contributing to open-source projects, tutoring aspiring developers, or experimenting with new technologies, I’m driven by a passion for learning and collaboration.
