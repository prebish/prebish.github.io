        <p>Hailing from Pittsburgh, I’m a software developer and tutor with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the
            University of Pittsburgh. I specialize in backend development, algorithms, and data structures — areas I
            find endlessly fascinating because they form the foundation of innovation.</p>
        <p>My journey into tech began at 17, when I discovered the limitless potential of programming. Since then, I’ve
            embraced coding as a superpower that empowers me to create, innovate, and make a meaningful impact. Whether
            it’s contributing to open-source projects, tutoring aspiring developers, or experimenting with new
            technologies, I’m driven by a passion for learning and collaboration.</p>
